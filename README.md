# Possessions

## A game of mischief-making, storytelling, and misdirected vengeance

Possessions is the digital implementation of a board game I made, built using [boardgame.io](http://boardgame.io) and React. Each player acts as a restless ghost,
grappling with the fragmented memories from their mortal lives,
shackled to the property where they died. The only way they can reach
fulfillment and pass through to the other side is by reacting - or
correcting - the most impactful relationships from their time on Earth
by possessing the current occupants.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Will need to run the backend separately.

### `yarn serve_dev`

Runs the server in the development mode. Will need to run the frontend separately.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn start`

Runs the production server that both hosts the bundled frontend code and runs the backend code.
